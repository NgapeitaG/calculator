// JavaScript Document
// make a variable named entries with the value of an empty array. (Holds sequence of values for equation. ) Sequence of equation

// make a variable named total with the value of ‘0’. (Total)

// make a variable named temp with the value of an empty string. (Entries of numbers and symbols )

// make a Jquery click method, where if you click on the button element, it will select and return the value of the button.
// make a if statement where there is a isNan function inside of it. 
// If the value is a number then assign the temp to the value. 
// temp equals temp + value.
// make a Jquery where the value of the answer ID returns a substring of temp, where the first 9 numbers are extracted.

// If not, assign ‘AC’ to the value. 
// add the AC symbol and it will clear the temp and all entries.

// If the ‘CE’ symbol is assigned to value, then temp will be cleared (most recent entry)

// if not, assign the multiplication symbol to the value.
// add the value to temp
// add the multiplication symbol to temp.
// add the multiplication symbol to our entries array.

// if not, assign the divided by symbol to value. 
// add temp to our entries
// add the divided by symbol to the entries array. 

// if not, assign equals to value.
// add temp to our entries. 
// make a variable named nt with the value of number and an argument which selects the first string or number in our entries array.
//For variable i is 1, i is less than the length of the entries string
// make variable nextNum which adds string in our entries array to the second.
// make variable symbol which has a selects the current symbol in our entries array.
// if symbol is a ‘+’ symbol, then the nt variable equals the first string in our entries array plus the next number or string in our array.
// if the symbol is not a + symbol, then our symbol is assigned the - symbol. 
// if the - symbol, then nt equals first string minus nextNum.
// if the symbol is the multiplication ‘*’ symbol, then nt equals the first string in our array [0] to have nextNum multiplied with it.
// if the symbol is not the previous symbol ‘*’, then the symbol is assigned to the / symbol.
// If / is assign to symbol, then nt equals the first string in our entries array to be divided by the nextNum.

// if nt is less than ‘0’, then nt equals the absolute number of nt plus the ‘-‘ (minus) symbol.
//(If the first number in the entries array is less than 0, than the minus symbol is added to it)

// otherwise add temp to our entries array
// add number to our entries array. 
// clear temp variable.
